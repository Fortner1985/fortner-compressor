## What Is This?

This is the web interface for the Fortner Smart Compression service. It lets you:

- **Compress** images (PNG, JPG, WebP, AVIF, BMP, TGA, TIFF, GIF) into the ultra-efficient `.fortner` format
- **Decompress** `.fortner` files back to PNG

## How It Works

Upload your image → the server compresses it → download the result. That's it.

The compression engine runs on a private server. This frontend is just the upload/download interface.
